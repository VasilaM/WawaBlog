                <h1 style="font-size: 3rem;">We spent 24 hours in a Wawa and wrote it all down</h1>
                                <div style="font-size: larger;">
                In the <a href="https://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/?a=d&d=TownTopics19740912-01.2.92&srpos=83&e=-------en-20--81-byDA-txt-txIN-wawa------">fall of 1974</a>, Wawa, a Philadelphia-based convenience market, first opened its doors at 140 University Place. For the last 50 years, Wawa, then open from 6 a.m. to midnight, but now on a 24-hour operation, has been Princeton students’ most reliable source of early-morning coffee, late-night quesadillas, and everything in between. 
                <br><br>
                Wawa is housed adjacent to the Princeton train station that connects the University to the cities that dot the Northeast Corridor. Within the Princeton community, Wawa is a watering hole for facilities workers, administrators, and students alike. 
                <br><br>
                In a July 1984 <a href="https://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/?a=d&d=Princetonian19840723-01.2.97&srpos=378&e=-------en-20--361-byDA-txt-txIN-wawa------">article</a> titled “The other side of midnight,” ‘Prince’ writer Michael Alcamo ’87 wrote, “It seems that the sun never rises or sets on Wawa as it does with the rest of the world. It’s like another planet, insulated from space and time. When did it all begin? When will it end, if ever?” Wawa is the site that binds together generations of University students in their perennial quest for mac-and-cheese after a night on the Street, caffeine to fuel senior thesis-drafting all-nighters, and a brief respite from Princeton’s ceaseless grind. There are few things certain in life: death, taxes, and Wawa. 
                <br><br>
                The ‘Prince’ staff sat in Wawa for 24 hours, observing the rotating cast of characters who enter and exit its doors, and the stories of those who work behind its counters. Reporters switched off hour by hour, each observing a part of the Wawa tapestry. While we found that the sun does indeed rise and set at Wawa, the ecosystem of students and workers who traverse its walls is certainly insulated from space and time.

                    <div class="blog-head">8–9 a.m.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">8:00 a.m. - We walk in. I’ve never seen the Wawa this quiet.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">8:10 a.m. - All of the traffic is centered at the coffee bar as people fuel up for the day. Three middle-aged men, all wearing baseball caps, stand around the coffee counter. One has a lottery ticket in his sweatshirt pocket and shakes three sugars into his coffee. </div>
                    <div class="blog-line">8:18 a.m. - The first traveler arrives with a bright maud-colored suitcase and buys a pretzel. </div>
                    <div class="blog-line">8:20 a.m. - Zander Silva ’27 approaches the self-checkout with a few bottles of Gatorade Zero and a cheese stick hot order (in the signature red Wawa container). Still in a sleek Princeton wrestling jacket, he just came from his morning run and lift, and has stopped to “fuel up for the day.” “I’m from New Jersey, so Wawa is kind of a staple,” he says in an interview with the ‘Prince.’ He’ll head back to Forbes College to submit a few essays, then attend his classes for the day.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">8:31 a.m. - The Wawa is quiet once again, except for a wailing coffee machine.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">8:37 a.m. - A man in a Building Services sweatshirt attempts to use the PNC Bank machine. But, it’s malfunctioning, so he shakes his head and walks away. </div>
                    <div class="blog-line">8:39 a.m. - “At 7:35, it went out,” a Wawa employee says, referencing the wailing coffee machine. </div>
                    <div class="blog-line">8:46 a.m. - The Wawa is still quiet except for Ariana Grande’s “No Tears Left to Cry” playing on the overhead speakers and the rustling of a Herr’s food distributor employee restocking the cheese curls. </div>
                    <div class="blog-line">8:57 a.m. - Lily, a Wawa employee, puts fresh coffee filters into the coffee machine to make a new batch. She’s been running between the counter and the coffee station all morning to replace creamers as the early morning crowd make their coffees — whole milk and Irish cream creamer seem to be the most popular choices this morning. </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="blog-post"  id="hour-1">
                    <div class="blog-head">9–10 a.m.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:10 a.m. - A Wawa employee making food hands a mobile order to Carter, an employee working behind the register. The man has a large and heavy bag and an iced coffee. </div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:16 a.m. - The Dinky alarm blares throughout Wawa. The 9:24 a.m. Dinky is “about to leave in seven minutes,” the alarm says.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:21 a.m. - Lily starts to call out orders that are ready at the counter. “378, waiting for payment!” she says. “380, quesadilla and a mac and cheese,” she says a few seconds later.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:27 a.m. - More Princeton Facilities Operations workers make up the majority of customers this morning.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:31 a.m. - Many people at Princeton aren’t aware of the typical morning rush that occurs at Wawas throughout the East Coast. Wawa is known to students as the late-night spot after studying for a midterm or spending long hours at the Street. Though Wawa may not be as bustling as it is at those hours, there’s always a steady crowd and a group of regulars in the morning.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:33 a.m. - Rebecca, with her white and purple visor on, brings over another mobile order bag to Carter. He multitasks, grabbing the bag while chatting with a woman at the register. She tries to scan her rewards on her phone. It fails a few times and then eventually goes through. The two both laugh.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:41 a.m. - Javier fixes one of the self-checkout machines after it breaks down.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:42 a.m. - Two men walk into Wawa with a comically large vacuum that extends from outside of the store. One continues to hand the other the vacuum as he vacuums near the bathrooms.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:43 a.m. - Javier is wearing a “Wawa &lt;3’s pizza” t-shirt. Wawa started offering pizza last month, but it won’t be available until 4 p.m. The pizza has garnered mixed reviews online. I personally enjoy it but understand how controversial it is. </div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:54 a.m. - One of the self-checkout machines continues to beep. No one is currently checking out. Carter continues to check people out at the register and ignores the noise.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">9:57 a.m. - Two women chat and laugh near the ATM with each other. The two walked into Wawa separately but now are talking about how one of them is finding a new place to live. The two say the words “oh my God” to each other no less than five times within the span of a minute.</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="blog-post" id="hour-2">
                    <div class="blog-head">10–11 a.m.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">10:05 a.m. - The cashier checks out a woman who works for the postal service, joking “$12.45 is your lucky number!” and wishing her a great day. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">10:09 a.m. - The line is long for the first time on this shift, with four people lined up at the cash register rather than the self-checkout, despite the self-checkout being open. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">10:14 a.m. - A man sporting a Campus Dining beanie purchases a red pack of cigarettes. The cashier seems to know what he wants before being asked. The line is long again now, with six people waiting to be checked out at one point. “The Edge of Glory” plays over the loudspeaker. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">10:18-10:22 a.m. - Brief interview with Kevin, the Assistant General Manager of Wawa. His favorite part of working here is that he’s a people person. He is expecting a ton of people tonight because of Dranksgiving, but says Monday nights are usually a lot quieter. On busier party nights, though, he says they can get up to 40 people in here at a time, and it becomes a social venue. He enjoys being part of the University community in that way. He says in the mornings, they get a ton of regulars, mostly people who work at the University. “We sell a TON of quesadillas,” he says.</div>

                    <div class="blog-line">10:25 a.m. - Suddenly it’s quiet. One person says on the way out, “You know, another Monday.”</div>

                    <div class="blog-line">10:26 a.m. - A man in a Campus Dining shirt gets cigarettes. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">10:33 a.m. - Kevin tells us that Radio Wawa picks the playlist. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">10:37 a.m. - General observations: The flag up right now is Princeton 2023. I wonder if they change it every year. Also, there is a pretty stained glass Princeton Wawa sign hanging in the window above the doors — perhaps from the original Wawa?</div>

                    <div class="blog-line">10:43 a.m. - Man behind the counter: “We had seven buses right downstairs. We made 2000 bucks in one hour. They just kept coming! I think they were here for a conference.” </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">10:59 a.m. - It is so cold outside. Wawa warms me from within.</div>

                </div>
                
                <div class="blog-post" id="hour-3">
                    <div class="blog-head">11–12 p.m.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">11:07 a.m. - The to-go orders are piling up, with four put out in the last couple of minutes. The line has ballooned to a half dozen people, including two guys in yellow construction vests and a very tall man in camo. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:14 a.m. - “Shake It Off” by Taylor Swift playing. The vibes in Wawa are not reciprocating. Unclear whether or not it’s Taylor’s version. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:19 a.m. - A man in a blue vest buys four packs of red Zyns. One of the machines by the register begins to beep. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:25 a.m. - Katy Perry’s “The One That Got Away” plays.</div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:29 a.m. - According to the Rewards app, I have 350 points to redeem. I try to purchase a hash brown but sadly discover that they are only available from 5 to 11 a.m. I suppose I can have my hash brown at the end of the night shift. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:31 a.m. - Several facilities workers have come through, most of them ordering sandwiches or other hot items, presumably for lunch. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:34 a.m. - General observation: I’m not sure I’ve seen a single student in here yet. I guess at 11 a.m. everyone does go to class. Except me. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:37 a.m. - After a lap of the store I have concluded that the most expensive packaged single item in Wawa (excluding things you can order at the kiosks) is 10 oz. beef jerky for $17.59. As of this time, it is $1 off for a price of $16.59. Equally terrifying, though less expensive: an uncomfortably long beef and cheddar stick. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:38 a.m. - An announcement for a train going to Penn Station. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:43 a.m. - A man in a brown suit walks out of Wawa very, very rapidly, sipping a massive soda. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:44 a.m. - In contrast to the morning, no one has said a word to anyone else in the last 10 minutes; people are probably rushing through their lunch breaks. “Titanium” by Sia hits its first big beat drop. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:46 a.m. - The gender balance in the last hour has been striking. Very few women have come in, and when they do, they are typically in groups. The current crowd is dominated by facilities workers, construction workers, and other people grabbing lunch. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:47 a.m. - A woman walks in! Still no students. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:49 a.m. - The speaker plays a Princeton Junction announcement for trains to Trenton. Why do we get those?</div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:53 a.m. - An exhausted-looking student in a Princeton chemistry sweatshirt grabs a to-go bag and a diet A&W root beer. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">11:54 a.m. - The lunch crowd continues to thicken, and orders are flying out of the sandwich section. </div>

                </div>
                <div class="blog-post" id="hour-4">
                    <div class="blog-head">12–1 p.m.</div>
                    <div class="blog-line">12:04 p.m. - A woman holding a small dog in one arm attempts to navigate the self-checkout. She seems to have difficulties with Apple Pay. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">12:06 p.m. - The crowd of people waiting for food has grown to at least 10. No one seems particularly happy, although that is perhaps because it is a Monday on a cold day in New Jersey. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">12:07 p.m. - A construction worker buys two of the aforementioned meat sticks, of the longer and skinnier variety. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">12:10 p.m. - “Toxic” by Britney Spears plays over the Dinky announcement. </div>

                    <div class="blog-line">12:14 p.m. - The lunch rush is in full swing. A woman in a Penn Medicine jacket talks on the phone in Spanish as she awaits her order. “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten blasts over the speaker. The woman in the jacket orders a salad and chicken.</div>

                    <div class="blog-line">12:19 p.m. - My Wawa order is ready: a chicken Parmesan hoagie. The cashier asks if I have a rewards card, which I present. He scolds me as I pay too quickly before scanning it.</div>

                    <div class="blog-line">12:23 p.m. - Outside Wawa, the northbound NJ Transit 605 bus arrives one minute ahead of schedule. A man boards but does not pay. Wawa sits at a transportation nexus; besides the Dinky, it serves two TigerTransit and one NJ Transit bus routes.</div>

She normally works the morning shift, which she prefers, but on Mondays, she works from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. The job gets challenging when the lines get long, or the mobile orders pile up. “But I like the people,” she says, nodding. </div>
